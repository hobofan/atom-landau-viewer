## Install

Install the Atom package via the Atom preferences or via:
```bash
apm install landau-viewer
```

## Usage

The plugin requires a instance of [landau-packager](https://github.com/landaujs/landau-packager) to be running.

A preview pane for the currently opened file can be opened via `ctrl-i` or `cmd-i` (OS X).

As of now, the preview model is regenerated every time the file is saved or a component is selected from the outline viewer.
